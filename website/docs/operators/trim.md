## Overview

The **TRIM** (Transfer Refined Iterative Modeling) operator is a _characterize_
operator that intelligently samples a `discoveryspace` to build a predictive
model for a target property. Unlike simple random sampling, TRIM uses active
learning to focus measurements on the most informative points, minimizing the
number of experiments needed to achieve good model accuracy.

### What does the TRIM operator do?

TRIM builds a machine learning model (using AutoGluon) that predicts a target
property across your entire `discoveryspace`. It does this by:

1. **Assessing existing data** in your space
2. **Gathering initial samples** if needed (no-priors characterization)
3. **Iteratively sampling** ensuring uniform coverage of the space, prioritizing
   uniformity on the most informative features
4. **Training intermediate models** and evaluating the expected improvement upon
   sampling additional points
5. **Producing a final model** trained on all collected data when the stopping
   criterion is met

### When should you use the TRIM operator?

Use TRIM when you want to:

- **Build a predictive model** for a target property across a large parameter
  space
- **Minimize measurement costs** by sampling only the most informative points
- **Automatically stop** when additional measurements provide diminishing
  returns
- **Characterize high-dimensional spaces** efficiently

TRIM is particularly valuable when:

- Measurements are expensive or time-consuming
- Your parameter space is large (hundreds to thousands of possible
  configurations)
- You want a model that can predict unmeasured points
- You need to balance exploration and exploitation

> [!CAUTION]
>
> TRIM trains supervised tabular machine learning models. The current version of
> TRIM requires that your experiment can obtain a target variable measurement
> for every entity in the space and that these measurements are of the same type
> (numbers or strings, vectors are not supported). More details

## How TRIM Works: The Three-Phase Workflow

Understanding TRIM's internal workflow helps you configure it effectively.

### Phase 1: Initial State Assessment

When you launch a TRIM operation, it first inspects your `discoveryspace`:

1. Counts how many entities already have measured values for your `targetOutput`
2. Compares this count against `samplingBudget.minPoints`
3. Decides whether to proceed directly to iterative modeling or gather more
   initial data via no-priors characterization

### Phase 2: No-Priors Characterization (Conditional)

This phase runs **only if** existing measured points <
`samplingBudget.minPoints`.

**Goal:** Build a small initial dataset with uniform coverage of the parameter
space. **Why it matters:** Starting with good initial coverage ensures the
iterative modeling phase has a solid foundation.

**How it works:**

- Uses a space-filling sampling strategy (Latin Hypercube, Sobol, etc.)
- Samples until `samplingBudget.minPoints` is reached

**Why it matters:** Starting with good initial coverage ensures the iterative
modeling phase has a solid foundation.

### Phase 3: Iterative Modeling

Once sufficient initial data exists, TRIM begins its main loop:

#### Step 1: Feature Importance Analysis

- Trains a temporary AutoGluon model on all available data
- Determines which input features (constitutive properties) are most important
  for predicting the target
- Keeps only the top `independentVariablesToKeep` features

#### Step 2: Smart Point Ordering

- Sorts all unmeasured points in the space
- Uses feature importance to prioritize a uniform projection of points on the
  most important feature dimensions

#### Step 3: Iterative Sampling and Training

For each iteration:

1. **Sample**
2. **Update** the training+validation and holdout datasets with new results
3. **Train** a new intermediate AutoGluon model
4. **Evaluate** model performance on the holdout set
5. **Check** stopping criterion

> [!NOTE] The holdout set
>
> The holdout set is made up of the last `holdoutSize` points that have been
> sampled.

#### Step 4: Stopping

After every point:

- Compares model performance between the last two non-overlapping windows of
  `iterationSize` points. Here's what this means:
  - TRIM trains a new model after sampling each new point
  - Each model is evaluated on its holdout set, producing a performance score
  - A "window" contains `iterationSize` consecutive performance scores
  - The "recent window" contains scores from the last `iterationSize` models
  - The "previous window" contains scores from the `iterationSize` models before
    that
  - Models trained later have more training data (higher training size)
- Calculates mean and standard deviation ratios, e.g. the mean performance
  metric of the last window divided by the mean performance metric of the
  previous one.
- Stops if both ratios fall below their thresholds (improvement has plateaued)
- Otherwise, continues sampling

#### Step 5: Final Model Generation

When the stopping criterion is met (or `samplingBudget.maxPoints` is reached):

- Trains one final, high-quality AutoGluon model
- Uses **all** data collected across all phases
- Saves to `finalModelAutoGluonArgs.tabularPredictorArgs.path` if specified, or
  to `outputDirectory` with `_finalized` suffix if not specified.
- This is your production-ready predictive model

## Complete Parameter Reference

All parameters are configured under the `parameters` key in your operation YAML.

### Core Configuration

#### `targetOutput`

**Type:** `str` (required)

**Purpose:** The measured property you want to predict. This is your "y"
variable.

**Tuning Guidance:** Must exactly match an output property identifier from your
experiment. All of TRIM's logic revolves around this target.

**Example:**

```yaml
parameters:
  targetOutput: pressure
```

#### `outputDirectory`

**Type:** `str | None`

**Default:** `None`

**Purpose:** Directory where AutoGluon models are saved. The final model is
saved in a subfolder with `_finalized` suffix.

**Tuning Guidance:** Always set this explicitly. If not set, models may be saved
to a temporary location and lost.

**Example:**

```yaml
parameters:
  outputDirectory: trim_models
```

---

### Phase 1: Initial Data Gathering

#### `samplingBudget`

Controls the overall sampling constraints.

##### `samplingBudget.minPoints`

**Type:** `int`

**Default:** `18`

**Purpose:** Minimum number of measured points required before iterative
modeling begins. If fewer points exist, triggers no-priors characterization.

**Tuning Guidance:**

- **Higher values** (e.g., 30-50): More robust initial dataset, better for
  high-dimensional spaces
- **Lower values** (e.g., 10-15): Faster start, but may lead to poor initial
  models
- **Rule of thumb:** Set to at least 2× the number of input features

**Example:**

```yaml
parameters:
  samplingBudget:
    minPoints: 25
```

##### `samplingBudget.maxPoints`

**Type:** `int`

**Default:** `40`

**Purpose:** Hard cap on total new points to measure. Acts as a cost-control
backstop.

**Tuning Guidance:**

- Set based on your measurement budget
- Operation stops when this limit is reached, regardless of model performance
- Should be significantly larger than `minPoints` to allow iterative
  improvement. Aim for at least `minPoints`×5.

**Example:**

```yaml
parameters:
  samplingBudget:
    minPoints: 20
    maxPoints: 100
```

#### `noPriorsParameters`

Configures the initial characterization phase (if triggered).

##### `noPriorsParameters.samples`

**Type:** `int`

**Purpose:** Number of unique points to sample during the initial no-priors
characterization phase.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If `samplingBudget.minPoints` is specified and differs from
> `noPriorsParameters.samples`, the value from `samplingBudget.minPoints` will
> take precedence. This ensures consistency between the sampling budget and the
> no-priors characterization phase.

##### `noPriorsParameters.sampling_strategy`

**Type:** `str`

**Default:** `'clhs'`

**Purpose:** Algorithm for selecting initial points.

**Supported values:**

- `'clhs'` (Concatenated Latin Hypercube): Excellent default, ensures even
  spread
- `'sobol'`: Quasi-random, often provides best uniform coverage
- `'random'`: Simple random sampling, can leave gaps

**Tuning Guidance:**

- Avoid `'random'` unless you have specific reasons

**Example:**

```yaml
parameters:
  noPriorsParameters:
    sampling_strategy: "sobol"
```

---

### Phase 2: Iterative Modeling Configuration

#### `iterationSize`

**Type:** `int`

**Default:** `5`

**Purpose:** Number of points sampled per iteration. Also defines the window
size for stopping criterion evaluation.

**Tuning Guidance:**

- **Larger values** (e.g., 8-10): More stable stopping decisions, less
  responsive
- **Smaller values** (e.g., 3-4): More responsive, but may stop prematurely
- **Trade-off:** Stability vs. responsiveness, 5 was a good value in almost all
  our tests.

#### `stoppingCriterion`

Controls when the iterative loop terminates.

##### `stoppingCriterion.enabled`

**Type:** `bool`

**Default:** `true`

**Purpose:** Enable/disable automatic stopping.

**Tuning Guidance:**

- Set to `false` to always run until `samplingBudget.maxPoints`
- Keep `true` for cost-efficient operation

##### `stoppingCriterion.meanThreshold`

**Type:** `float`

**Default:** `0.9`

**Purpose:** Threshold for mean performance ratio between consecutive windows.

**How it works:** TRIM calculates:

```text
mean_ratio = mean(recent_window_scores) / mean(previous_window_scores)
```

If `1/meanThreshold < mean_ratio < meanThreshold`, the mean has stabilized.

**Tuning Guidance:**

- **Lower values** (e.g., 0.8): Less patient, stops sooner
- **Higher values** (e.g., 0.95): More patient, continues longer
- Use higher values when accuracy is critical

##### `stoppingCriterion.stdThreshold`

**Type:** `float`

**Default:** `0.75`

**Purpose:** Threshold for standard deviation ratio between consecutive windows.

**How it works:** TRIM calculates:

```text
std_ratio = std(recent_window_scores) / std(previous_window_scores)
```

If `std_ratio < stdThreshold`, the variance has stabilized.

**Tuning Guidance:**

- Controls sensitivity to score variability
- Lower values require more stable performance before stopping

**Stopping Logic:** Both `mean_ratio < meanThreshold` AND
`std_ratio < stdThreshold` must be true to trigger stopping.

**Example:**

```yaml
parameters:
  stoppingCriterion:
    enabled: true
    meanThreshold: 0.85
    stdThreshold: 0.7
```

- [TabularPredictor API](https://auto.gluon.ai/dev/api/autogluon.tabular.TabularPredictor.html)
- [TabularPredictor.fit() API](https://auto.gluon.ai/cloud/stable/api/autogluon.cloud.TabularCloudPredictor.fit.html)

#### `autoGluonArgs`

Configures **intermediate** models trained during the iterative loop.

##### `tabularPredictorArgs`

Dictionary passed to `TabularPredictor()` constructor. Refer to AutoGluon
documentation for details.

##### `fitArgs`

Dictionary passed to `TabularPredictor.fit()`. Refer to AutoGluon documentation
for details.

**Tuning Guidance for Intermediate Models:**

- Keep `time_limit` low (30-60s) for fast iterations
- Use `'medium_quality'` presets

#### `finalModelAutoGluonArgs`

Configures the **final** production model.

**Default:** If not specified, uses same settings as `autoGluonArgs`

**Tuning Guidance for Final Model:**

- Use much higher `time_limit` (600-1800s)
- Consider using `'best_quality'` or `'high_quality'` presets.

**Example:**

```yaml
parameters:
  autoGluonArgs:
    fitArgs:
      time_limit: 45
      presets: "medium_quality"
  finalModelAutoGluonArgs:
    fitArgs:
      time_limit: 1200
      presets: "best_quality"
```

## Understanding TRIM Output

### Viewing Sampled Entities

To see the entities sampled during a TRIM operation:

```bash
ado show entities operation $OPERATION_IDENTIFIER
```

This displays entities in the order they were sampled, showing the progression
through the no-priors and iterative phases.

### Accessing the Final Model

The final AutoGluon model is saved to:

```text
{outputDirectory}_finalized/
```

You can load and use it for predictions:

```python
from autogluon.tabular import TabularPredictor

predictor = TabularPredictor.load('trim_models_finalized')
predictions = predictor.predict(new_data)
```

### Operation Metadata

TRIM operations create metadata tracking:

- Number of entities submitted
- Number of experiments requested
- Which phase completed (no-priors vs. iterative)

Access via:

```bash
ado show details operation $OPERATION_IDENTIFIER
```

## Advanced Topics

### Relationship with RandomWalk

TRIM internally uses the `RandomWalk` operator with custom samplers:

- **No-priors phase:** Uses `NoPriorsSampleSelector`
- **Iterative phase:** Uses `TrimSampleSelector`

This means TRIM inherits RandomWalk's capabilities like measurement replay.

### Feature Importance and Dimensionality Reduction

TRIM uses AutoGluon's feature importance to:

1. Identify which input parameters matter most
2. Order unmeasured points based on important features

This makes TRIM efficient even in high-dimensional spaces.

### Holdout Set Mechanism

TRIM maintains a rolling holdout set:

- Size: `holdoutSize` (equals `iterationSize`)
- Composition: Most recently measured points
- Purpose: Evaluate model generalization without overfitting
- Used for: Stopping criterion calculations

### Debugging and Troubleshooting

The current version of TRIM assumes that all measurements produce the observed
target output property, if this is not the case TRIM raises
`InsufficientDataError`. To inspect what happened you can show the entities in
the space with the following command

```terminal
ado show entities --use-latest space
```

Looking at the output you will find out if the target output property
`targetOutput` is not a measured property of the entities in the space. In this
case you will see a message such as

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

```terminal
INFO:   Nothing was returned for entity type measured and property format target in space space-12ba2a-f09e16.
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

If you see entities instead, then some of these entities probably do not contain
valid values for `targetOutput`. You can inspect these values and search for
invalid ones such as `NANs` or `None` in the `targetOutput` column of the table
you see on your terminal. To facilitate the detection of the column, you can run
the same command with a property filter:

```terminal
ado show entities --use-latest space --property [targetOutput]
```

Here, remember to replace `"[targetOutput]"` with `targetOutput`.

If you still need to troubleshoot, enable debug logging to save intermediate
files. Set logging level when you launch your operation, for example:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

```bash
LOGLEVEL=DEBUG ado -l DEBUG create operation -f \
  operation_pressure.yaml --use-latest space
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

Debug logging saves source/target dataframes at each iteration. Set your
preference for the debug directory in your experiment configuration:

```yaml
parameters:
  debugDirectory: debug_output
```
