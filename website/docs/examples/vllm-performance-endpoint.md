## The scenario

A model deployed for inference will have a certain max stable throughput in
terms of the requests it can serve per second.
Sending more requests than this maximum will often lead to a drop in throughput.
Hence, it can be useful to know what this maximum is so the maximum throughput
is reliably maintained e.g. by limiting
the max number of concurrent requests.

**In this example, the _vllm_performance_ actuator is used to find
the maximum requests per second a server can handle while maintaining
stable maximum throughput.**

To explore this space, you will:

- define an endpoint, model and range of requests per second to test
- use an optimizer to efficiently find the maximum requests per second

## Install the actuator

If you haven't already:

```commandline
pip install ado-vllm-performance
```

If you have cloned the `ado` source repository you can also do:

```commandline
# From the root of this repository 
pip install -e plugins/actuators/vllm_performance
```

Verify the installation with:

```commandline
ado get actuators --details 
```

The actuator `vllm_performance` will appear in the list of available actuators.

## Define the request rates to test

This `discoveryspace` includes all
request rates from 10 to 100 for an endpoint
serving `gpt-oss-20b`:

```yaml
# Example discovery space for vLLM performance
sampleStoreIdentifier: <sample_store_id>
entitySpace:
  - identifier: model
    propertyDomain:
      values:
        - openai/gpt-oss-20b
  - identifier: endpoint
    propertyDomain:
      values:
        - http://localhost:8000
  - identifier: request_rate
    propertyDomain:
      domainRange: [10,100]
      interval: 1
experiments:
- actuatorIdentifier: vllm_performance
  experimentIdentifier: performance-testing-endpoint
```

Save the above as `vllm_discoveryspace.yaml`.
Then, if you have an existing `samplestore`, run:

```bash
ado create space -f vllm_discoveryspace.yaml --set sampleStoreIdentifier=$SAMPLE_STORE_ID
```

otherwise create a new one:

```bash
ado create space -f vllm_discoveryspace.yaml --new-sample-store
```

Record the identifier of the created `discoveryspace` as it
will be used in next section.

> [!NOTE]

> More complex `discoveryspace`s can be created,
> for example also including the number of input tokens.

## Use hyperopt to find the best input request rate

[Hyperopt](http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/) uses
[Tree-Parzen Estimators (TPE)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2011/file/86e8f7ab32cfd12577bc2619bc635690-Paper.pdf)
which is a bayesian approach that is expected to be good for discrete dimensions
and noisy metrics, which we have here i.e. `request_throughput`.

The following operation will look for points (in this case `request_rate`s)
which lead to a `request_throughput` in the top 20 percentile:

```yaml
spaces:
  - space-ccf2bf-a50274 #substitute with your space id or override when running
operation:
  module:
    operatorName: "ray_tune"
    operationType: "search"
  parameters:
    tuneConfig:
      metric: "request_throughput" # The metric to optimize
      mode: 'max'
      num_samples: 16
      search_alg:
        name: hyperopt
        n_initial_points: 8 #Number of points to sample before optimizing 
        gamma: 0.25 #The top gamma fraction of measured values are considered "good"
```

Save the above as `hyperopt.yaml`. Then create the operation:

```commandline
ado create operation -f hyperopt.yaml --set "spaces[0]=$DISCOVERY_SPACE_ID"
```

where `$DISCOVERY_SPACE_ID` is the identifier of the `discoveryspace`
you created in the previous step.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Hyperopt samples with replacement so you may see the same points
> sampled twice.
> The likelihood increase as number of points in the space decreases

### Monitor the optimization

You can see the measurement requests as the operation runs
by executing (in another terminal):

```commandline
ado show requests operation $OPERATION_ID
```

and the results (this outputs the entities in sampled order):

```commandline
ado show entities operation $OPERATION_ID
```

If the `operation` is running the $OPERATION_ID will have been output
just before the sampling started.
Assuming no other operation was started it will also be
the last id output by

```commandline
ado get operations
```

### Check final results

When the output indicates that the experiment has finished, you
can inspect the results of all operations run so far on the space with:

```commandline
ado show entities space $DISCOVERY_SPACE_ID --output-format csv
```

> [!NOTE]

> At any time after an operation, $OPERATION_ID, is finished you can run
> `ado show entities operation $OPERATION_ID`
> to see the sampling time-series of that operation.

## Some notes on hyperopt and TPE

What you should observe is that as the search proceeds **hyperopt**
will start to prefer to sample points in the region with stable maximum,
even if it has seen better values in "unstable" regions.

> [!IMPORTANT]

> focusing its attention

TPE builds models of where the "good" regions and "bad" regions of the
discovery space are i.e. `P(x|good)`, `P(x|bad)`, where x is an input point.
It then chooses new points to test by maximizing  `P(x|good)/P(x|bad)`

This makes TPE robust to noise in request_throughput as its not trying to find
where the maximum is but is trying to find the request_rates that are most likely
to give high throughput (above defined as throughput in top 20 percentile).
This also makes it robust to outliers.

Problems can arise if the best region is not sampled in the initial points
and this region  is disjoint from other regions with "good" performance.
As the search runs it will be directed towards where it has already seen good values
and the best region is unlikely to be visited.

## Next steps

- Use `ado describe experiment vllm_performance_endpoint` to see what
other parameters can be explored
- Try varying **`burstiness`** or **`number_input_tokens`**, or adding
them as dimensions of the `entityspace`, to explore their impact on throughput
- Try varying `num_samples`, `gamma` and `n_initial_points` parameters of hyperopt
  - You can keep running the optimization on the same `discoveryspace`.
    The previous runs will not influence new runs, but their results will
    be reused, speeding experimentation up
- Measure the [performance of vLLM deployment configurations](vllm-performance-full.md)
