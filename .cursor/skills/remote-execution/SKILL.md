name: remote-execution
description: Run ado operations on remote Ray clusters using --remote execution context
  files. Use when the user wants to create an operation, asks about remote clusters,
  wants to ship local plugins or data files to a cluster, or asks about execution context
  YAML files. Also applies proactively when creating an operation if execution context
  files are present in the workspace.

# Remote Execution with ado

## Execution context files

An execution context YAML configures a specific cluster and environment.
Multiple files can exist in the same repo for different clusters or
environments:

```text
morrigan_execution.yaml          # Morrigan cluster, standard env
vela_execution.yaml              # Vela cluster
morrigan_vllm_dev_execution.yaml # Morrigan + vllm_performance from source
```

The file names are user-defined conventions. Check the repo root for any
`*_execution.yaml` files to discover what contexts are available.

See `website/docs/getting-started/remote_run.md` for full schema reference.

---

## Proactive prompt when creating operations

When the user asks to create an operation, **check the repo root for
`*_execution.yaml` files**. If any exist, ask which (if any) they want to
use before proceeding. Do not assume remote by default — local execution is
still common.

Do **not** dispatch other ado commands (`get`, `show`, `create space`, etc.)
remotely unless the user explicitly requests it.

---

## Prerequisites

Before dispatching to a cluster with port-forward, verify cluster login:

```bash
oc whoami   # OpenShift
# or
kubectl get nodes   # Kubernetes
```

If this fails, log in first — the port-forward will fail with a credentials
error otherwise.

---

## Project context

The active local project context is automatically forwarded to the remote job.
To work on the same project locally and remotely, use the same active context
for both — do not add a separate `-c` flag unless explicitly switching context:

```bash
# Local: uses active context
uv run ado create space -f space.yaml

# Remote: forwards the same active context automatically
uv run ado --remote morrigan_execution.yaml create operation \
    -f operation.yaml --use-latest space
```

Only supply `-c context.yaml` when you need to target a different project
than the one currently active.

---

## Operation creation command patterns

**One step** — create space and operation together remotely:

```bash
uv run ado --remote execution_context.yaml create operation \
    -f operation.yaml \
    --with space=space.yaml
```

**Two steps** — create space locally, run operation remotely:

```bash
uv run ado create space -f space.yaml
uv run ado --remote execution_context.yaml create operation \
    -f operation.yaml --use-latest space
```

Prefer the two-step pattern when you want the space registered in the local
metastore (e.g. for local querying or validation) before submitting.

## Common Issues

### file paths in YAML not valid on the remote cluster

Any file path appearing in a space, operation, or actuator configuration YAML
(e.g. `mps_file`, a model checkpoint, a dataset path) must satisfy **both**
conditions for the remote job to succeed:

- **File not present on cluster**: add the local path to `additionalFiles`
  in the execution context YAML.
- **Path invalid on cluster**: use a bare filename in the YAML; ado symlinks
  `additionalFiles` entries into the Ray working dir, so `my-file.gz`
  resolves but `/Users/me/data/my-file.gz` does not.

Failing either condition produces a file-not-found error at experiment runtime,
not at submission time, so the job starts successfully but measurements fail.

#### Pattern to follow

To avoid, if the experiment references a file use a **bare
filename** (no path) in the space/operation YAML. Add the absolute local path
to `additionalFiles`; ado symlinks it into the Ray working directory so the
bare filename resolves on the cluster.

```yaml
# space.yaml
entitySpace:
  - identifier: mps_file
    propertyDomain:
      variableType: OPEN_CATEGORICAL_VARIABLE_TYPE
      values:
        - pigeon-10.mps.gz   # bare filename — resolves from working dir
```

```yaml
# execution_context.yaml
additionalFiles:
  - /absolute/local/path/to/pigeon-10.mps.gz
```

The same applies to actuator configuration files that reference local paths
(e.g. model weights, config files). Audit all `-f` files for local path
references before dispatching remotely.

### Ray version mismatch

If you see `Changing the ray version is not allowed`, pin the Ray version in
`fromPyPI` to match the cluster:

```yaml
fromPyPI:
  - ado-core
  - ray==2.52.1   # match the cluster's installed version
  - ado-ray-tune
```
